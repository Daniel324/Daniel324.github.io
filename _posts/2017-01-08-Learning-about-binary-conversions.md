In this lesson, we answered a series of questions, asking us the convert binary into decimal, and vice versa. I found it a lot easier to do if I drew out the units and used a visual representation of the columns. It looked something like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>128</td>
    <td>64</td>
    <td>32</td>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>


After drawing out the columns you line up the binary and add up all the numbers with a "1" under them, this gives you the decimal number. We also learnt that:

 00001111 = 15

And

11110000 = 240 

This is important to remember as it can shorten the time it takes for you to convert binary into decimal. We started to make a Google sheet that would convert for us, making it a lot easier to do.
