After the immense frustration of dealing with my tables I came to the conclusion that I should get rid of tables all together, so here is my first blog post without a table.

This lesson I researched some effects I could add to my website to make it look better, I found out how to make my container have a drop shadow by changing something in my style.scss file:

Container {	box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;

}

I also decided to add a curved border for my container which was relatively easy to do as Mr Tansley had already done it to his website:

Container {	border-radius: 10px;

}

I think sound this has greatly influenced the overall look of my website, as well as some minor changes and some testing that is what my website will look like for now. After being momentarily satisfied with the presentation of my website I realised that one of my tables had done something really strange, like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>


This was really strange as my other posts were not having the same problem and I didn't change anything in the post to cause this to happen, when clicking on the "read more" button the table was normal again, upon going back to the home screen it had done it again and it was really strange, so this is why I've given up on tables completely.
