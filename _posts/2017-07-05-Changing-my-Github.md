After having the same white background, the same font, and the same overall look for several months, I decided to change my Github and take on a new color scheme. This was productive as I had forgotten many of the things that Ihad put in my style.scss and refreshing my memory was very helpful.

The first thing that I decided to change was my background, I wanted something quite neutral and professional. Once I had found my image I got the URL and put it into the correct line in my style.scss, it took a while for the changes to show up but while they did I was already getting to work on my next change, The body. Using the handy in-built RGB color picker google has, I started going through the colors to see what I like, I went for a blue color, I would then incorporate this color into other parts of my blog. I then went on to change my avatar, I searched up some GIFs and eventually found a nice one that really suited me. Making these changes really helped me remember how to edit my blog layout, and its look.
