After doing our topic on blogging and spreadsheets last half term I was eager to start a new topic with a new teacher, Mr Keen, and it only got better as I learnt that our new topic was cryptography. I am quite interested in this topic as I was in house codebreaking in year 7 and I enjoyed it lots. I was also interested about how this would tie into IT and computational thinking.

During the lesson we did a simple Caesar cipher, these were very easy as the letters were just shifted one or two characters. I completed the task by using some of the "learning at challoners" habits, like using past knowledge from when I had researched this before, and perseverance, as deciphering the codes can be very long and tedious at times. I am excited to learn more on this topic and research it for homework.
