Today we had our final lesson, I finished editing my github for the last time and made sure all my blogs were posted. On google classroom there was an assignment to hand in our blogs. There was also a link to a website with code games on, I played some CodeCombat which was quite fun to play. I also added a bit more to my quiz and put a few more questions in. I have enjoyed my year of IT and feel that I have learnt quite a lot of things that I did not know before. It has also changed how I think and come up with solutions to problems. Using Repl.it has also increased my ability to use python which is a surprisingly useful skill. My calculator has become very useful and can do a variety of things with just a few keypresses. I have learnt how to use many functions in python like print, input, len, int and str just to name a few. I wish to become better at python and be able to code more complex programs.
