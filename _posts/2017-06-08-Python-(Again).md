After a few months of drama i'm back doing IT, I was delighted to see that I had Mr. Tansley as my teacher. During the lesson I was told that we would be continuing our blogs and our work in Repl.it. I decided to carry on adding features to my calculator, like a pet years function.

In this function I asked the user what. Breed of dog they had and how old it currently was. I calculated the age by telling whether the dog was under a certain number of years old and then multiplied the age by how long a year is for a dog at that age. I had to do this as older dogs age slower than puppies, so this feature made it accurate. I then found a list of dog breeds and how long their average lifespan is, I then made it tell the user how many years on average their dog has left of its life. This was done by subtracting its current age by the average lifespan.
