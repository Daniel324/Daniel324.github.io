Over the last few weeks we have been adding to a quiz. In this quiz, you are given choices to certain questions, these are multiple choice questions, the advantage of this is that there will always be a definite answer that is useful to giving an answer at the end. If the user refuses to choose one of the options, the question is repeated until a correct answer is given. This answer is then recorded and a tally is added to one of three categories. Another question is asked and the cycle repeats until all 11 questions have been answered. The fact that the number of questions is an odd number is important as it will always give a definite answer that has the most tallies. The corresponding answer is then given to the user and they can choose to retake the quiz or to exit.
