Today we continued with our repl.it program, for last weeks homework, I added a few more questions which used different functions like "elif" and “else”. I was excited to add more to my program as I enjoyed making it last lesson, we learnt how to make repeats using “while”. We accomplished this by setting repeat to 1 and changing it to 0 when we wanted it to stop, braking the “while” loop. This can be used in lots of situations like restarting to the first question, continuing to ask a question and many more. Over the half term we have been tasked to create a calculator with options like area of a circle, area of a cube, addition and subtraction. This task was relatively easy but if found it difficult to make it so you can add 2 numbers or maybe 10 numbers at a time.
