Today we were introduced to ASCII, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. This is still used today and has proved very useful. Because ASCII was created in 7-bit, normal 8-bit computers could not use it, this explains  the zero in front of every binary value in ASCII. ASCII is quite simple to learn and can be used very easily.

We were tasked to create a spreadsheet that could translate letters into binary using ASCII, we needed to use a few functions including Vlookup and concatenate, which is used to put back together the binary values, to make a full code. This was relatively easy and uses some of the functions we had already learnt. I am looking forward to learning more about what we can do with ASCII next lesson.
