Continuing from last week, we are now doing more conversions, but this time with hex, hex is like any other language, but hex goes from 1-9 and A-F, this means that hex is base 16. We are working towards converting Binary to Hex, and missing out decimal completely, this will make our conversions a lot quicker. We also continued adding to our spreadsheet, by using functions like Dec2Bin and Hex2Dec, these are very helpful as it would be almost impossible to make our tables work without it. A lot of these conversions can be done with methods, like this:

	As an example we can convert 00110110

	The 0110, is equal to 6, and the 0011 is equal to 3,

	Therefore i hex, 00110110 is 36, but not the 36 we are used to using.

This method is used for all conversions and only gets easier when you do it more often, this is why we have been practicing it this lesson to make it a lot quicker to do.
