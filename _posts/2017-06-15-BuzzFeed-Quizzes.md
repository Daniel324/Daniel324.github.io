This lesson we looked at the quizzes page on the buzzfeed website and saw how the quizzes are structured. They are a series of multiple choice questions which give you a result at the end of the quiz saying what the quiz makes of your answers. The quizzes are all rather with results telling you "what you really are".

When creating my own quiz, I decided to use closed questions. When they answered a question i made a tally of how many As or Bs there were in total, at the end of the quiz I said what they answered more of, and this would be the answer to the title question. The questions were made by using the Variable = input("Question") function. This function is how you ask a question. At the end I used a function that counted how many As or Bs there were and said the outcome based on the higher amount. I made it so there was an odd amount of questions to make it easier and more stable.
