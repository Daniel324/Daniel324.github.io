Repl.it is an internet site where you can create your own programs in many languages like CSS and C++. But today we are using python 3. We created a simple program which asked questions and set the answer to a variable. We encountered a problem that unless you accounted for every single answer possible, you could never really have a "perfect" program, this is why we resorted to multiple choice questions, this eliminated this problem and if they refused to answer either A, B, C or D, it would ask you to reassert the question. This was a very effective method and can be used for the majority of questions, I am looking forward to seeing what more we can do with Repl.It.
